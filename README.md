## Project Description
The query in this project sorts customer data using the `ORDER BY` clause:
- **FirstName** is sorted in **ascending (ASC)** order.  
- **LastName** is sorted in **descending (DESC)** order.  

This example shows how `ORDER BY` can be used to organize query output for easier analysis and readability.
